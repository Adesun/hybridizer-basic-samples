### hybridizer-basic-samples
This repo illustrates a few samples for Hybridizer

These samples may be used with any version of Hybridizer including Hybridizer Essentials.
They illustrate features of the solution and are a good starting point for experimenting and developing software based on Hybridizer.

## Requirements
Before you start, you first need to check if you have the right environment. 
Everything is tested with Visual Studio Community 2015 only. So we strongly recommend to use this version of Visual Studio, until we ensure it's working properly with 2012/2013/2017. 
You need a CUDA-enabled GPU and CUDA 8.0 installed (with the CUDA driver). 
Obviously, you need a version of Hybridizer, and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=altimesh.AltimeshHybridizerExtensionEssentials" target="_blank">Hybridizer Essentials</a> will do the job. 

## Run
Checkout repository, and open Visual Studio 2015 Community. 
Follow instructions on get_started.mp4 (require and validate license). 
Open HybridizerBasicSamples solution. 
Build example of your choice and run it. 

## Wiki
Samples are explained in the [wiki](https://github.com/altimesh/hybridizer-basic-samples/wiki).
